# E-commerce Recommendation Engine  

📌 **Project Overview**  
This project builds an **E-commerce Recommendation Engine** to improve customer engagement and increase sales by providing personalized product recommendations.  
The system suggests relevant products to users based on browsing history, purchase history, and product similarities.  

---

### 🎯 Objectives  
- Predict which items a user is most likely to engage with or purchase.  
- Provide recommendations using collaborative filtering and similarity-based models.  
- Deploy the system in a simple web interface for testing and demonstration.  

---

### 🛠️ Project Scope  
The recommendation engine will:  
- Use a publicly available dataset (`amazon.csv`).  
- Explore user behavior and item features through **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**.  
- Train and validate models with baseline approaches (popularity-based, similarity-based).  
- Evaluate performance with ranking metrics:  
  - Precision@K  
  - Recall@K  
  - NDCG  
- Be deployed in a simple interface (Streamlit).

### 📂 Project Workflow  

#### 1. Setup & Initialization  
- Import necessary libraries (`pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`).  
- Load dataset (`amazon.csv`).  

#### 2. Data Overview & Cleaning  
- Inspect dataset shape, columns, and head.  
- Clean columns and adjust datatypes.  
- Handle missing values and duplicates.  
- Check and correct **data skewness**.  
- Detect and handle **outliers**.  
- Explore **unique values** across key features.  

#### 3. Data Preprocessing  
- Remove irrelevant columns.  
- Split dataset into **train/test sets**.  
- Save the cleaned dataset for reproducibility.  

#### 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- **Analysis:** Explore user patterns, item popularity, and activity distribution.  
- **Relations:** Study correlations and feature interactions.  

#### 5. Model Development  
- Build recommendation models.  
- Define model **architecture** (similarity-based / collaborative filtering).  
- Train models on interaction data.  
- Validate with ranking metrics (Precision@K, Recall@K, NDCG).  

#### 6. Deployment  
- Deploy the trained model in a simple **web app (Streamlit)**.  
- Allow users to enter a user ID and receive personalized recommendations.

### 🚀 Deliverables  
- A trained recommendation engine with evaluation metrics.  
- A cleaned dataset (`amazon_cleaned.csv`).  
- A short summary report explaining the approach and performance.  
- A simple web interface for testing the system.
