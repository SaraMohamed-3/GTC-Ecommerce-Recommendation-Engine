# E-commerce Recommendation Engine

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to build an **E-commerce Recommendation Engine** to improve customer engagement and increase sales by providing **personalized product recommendations**.  
The system will suggest relevant products to users based on their browsing history, purchase history, and product similarities.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Predict which items a user is most likely to engage with or purchase.
- Provide recommendations using collaborative filtering and similarity-based models.
- Deploy the system in a simple web interface for testing and demonstration.

## 🛠️ Project Scope
The recommendation engine will:
1. Use publicly available datasets with user–item interactions (ratings, purchases, clicks, or views).
2. Explore user behavior and item features through **EDA** (Exploratory Data Analysis).
3. Train and validate models with baseline approaches (popularity-based, matrix factorization, nearest-neighbor).
4. Evaluate performance with metrics like:
   - **Precision@K**
   - **Recall@K**
   - **NDCG**
5. Be deployed in a simple interface (Streamlit or JavaScript frontend).

## 📂 Project Workflow
1. **Data Preparation**
   - Find and preprocess dataset(s).
   - Handle missing values and convert IDs to numeric indices.

2. **EDA & Feature Engineering**
   - Explore user patterns, item popularity, and activity distribution.
   - Build interaction matrices and similarity features.

3. **Model Training & Validation**
   - Train baseline and advanced recommender models.
   - Evaluate with ranking metrics.

4. **Deployment**
   - Deploy the model in a web app.
   - Allow users to enter a user ID and receive personalized recommendations.

## 🚀 Deliverables
- A trained recommendation engine with evaluation metrics.
- A short summary report explaining the approach and performance.
- A simple web interface for testing the system.
